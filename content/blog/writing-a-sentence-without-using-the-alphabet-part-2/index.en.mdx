In my previous post, I wrote that I couldn't make some characters, but I found [one that suggested a solution to the problem](http://patriciopalladino.com/blog/2012/08/09/non-alphanumeric-javascript.html) within a few days. And there was already an implementation that created JavaScript code with only six characters `(` `)` `+` `[` `]` `!`. [JSF*ck](http://www.jsfuck.com/), [Hieroglyphy](http://patriciopalladino.com/files/hieroglyphy/)

I was a bit sad that there was already such a code converter, but the content was so interesting that I implemented it myself.

Enter text below to convert all characters, including alphabets and numbers, into code.
