On January 20, the first COVID-19 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea, and the number of confirmed cases surged since then, experiencing an unprecedented emergency. The company started a telecommuting system, and the telecommuting, which had been expected to end in a short period of time, lasted for more than two months and was only available to meet colleagues via LAN.

Finishing two months of telecommuting, I visualized the trend from the outbreak of COVID-19 to the end of telecommuting.
